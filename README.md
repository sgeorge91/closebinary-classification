# closebinary-classification
Codes associated with George et. al. (2019) Chaos
Contains codes that were used to analyze close eclipsing bianries in the Kepler field of view and then classified them into contact, semi contact and ellipsoidal binary stars.
Construction of recurrence netowrks needs to be used in conjunction with TISEAN code for autocorrelation, whereas the heterogeinity cdoe is based on Jacob, Rinku, et al. "Measure for degree heterogeneity in complex networks and its application to recurrence network analysis." Royal Society open science 4.1 (2017): 160757. and the code can be found on https://sites.google.com/site/kphk11/home/nonlinear-time-series-analysis-tools
